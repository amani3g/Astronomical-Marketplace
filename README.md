# Astronomical-Marketplace

This is the Astronomical Marketplace, which queries the EAOT database and returns a daily exoplanet.

Each exoplanet has a % of habitability that will be calculated referencing Mullalay 2019.

This includes code that will publish a planet on the polygon blockchain for a limited release. 

Users will be allowed to trade their planets on the Astronomical Marketplace.
